# ðŸ¦Š Fennec UI

![Demo Screenshot](demo.png)

*Clean browsing with integrated Sideberry sidebar - no visual clutter, just pure functionality.*

A minimal Firefox CSS theme designed for **first-class Sideberry support** without the typical Firefox UI baggage. Inspired by the elegant UX philosophy of Zen Browser.

Perfect for users who want the stability of using the Firefox browser with the aesthetics of modern, minimal browsers.

- **Seamless Sideberry Integration** - Urlbar inside the sidebar-box, aligned url and icons

- **Minimal Chrome** - Remove unnecessary Firefox UI elements that clutter the experience  

- **Zen-Mode** - Toggle the entire ui with UTE addon for focused reading

Zen-Mode requires Userchrome Toggle Extended, when configured properly, a "fullscreen" type mode is achieved, but with the unique benefit the window can be tiled.

When the UI is completely hidden, fennec will attempt (no garuntee, firefox chrome changes can break logic) to surface some but not all security relevant signals (like http warning). This is not a solution against phishing and many other attacks, users should only toggle the UI after url/content has been verified as secure

## Installation
