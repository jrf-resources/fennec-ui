- **Seamless Sideberry Integration** - The sidebar becomes a natural part of the interface
- **Minimal Chrome** - Remove unnecessary Firefox UI elements that clutter the experience  
- **Zen-Inspired Design** - Clean, purposeful aesthetics focused on content
- **Distraction-Free Browsing** - Let your content and workflow take center stage

## Installation

1. Enable `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` in `about:config`
2. Navigate to your Firefox profile folder
3. Create a `chrome` folder if it doesn't exist
4. Copy `userChrome.css` to the `chrome` folder

## Philosophy

This theme embraces the principle that **the best interface is the one you don't notice**. By removing Firefox's visual baggage and creating seamless integration with Sideberry, we achieve a browsing experience that feels purposeful and distraction-free - much like what Zen Browser aims to provide, but with the flexibility and extensibility of Firefox.

Perfect for users who want the power of Firefox with the clean aesthetics of modern, minimal browsers.
